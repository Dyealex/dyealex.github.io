    <h2>And the journey begins...the decision</h2>
    <p>The link below takes you to a video that tells you everything you never wanted to know about the level of insanity required to train for an Ironman race.</p>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/B03dFMG8nR4" target="blank">The funniest Ironman video ever...</a>
<p>To decide to participate in an Ironman race takes a fair amount of determination, tenacity and guts. When I started participating in triathlons in 2010, I could not wrap my head around how you could possibly think this was &ldquo;doable&rdquo;&excl; To swim 2.4 miles, bike 112 miles and run 26.2 miles...all in the same day. The sprint distance triathlon I was preparing for seemed far-fetched and it was a mere 600yd swim, a 13 mile bike ride and 3.1 mile run. Plus to go out there with the knowledge that you are not an elite athlete; maybe not even a so-so athlete takes courage. Hitting the send button on the registration only begins the journey. The double digit runs, the 100 mile bike rides, hours in the pool. All of this to prepare for the uncertain. The uncertain is...will the race be canceled? It can and has happened. Will the race be postponed? That can and has happened. Am I ready? You will find out. What diversity will I face on raceday? These are all unknowns. The only thing for certain is you just spent a lot of money on a maybe. Maybe I will finish...this time.</p></div>
<div id = columbiaMarathon class="divPosition">
    <p>To prepare for Ironman Maryland, I chose to run my first marathon. It is an important "mental factor" to at least know in the back of your mind that you CAN do it. Trouble was, I sunk to the level of my training on that day. You are alloted 6 hours to complete the marathon. I was 16 minutes over and damn lucky to have my best pal Julie with me every step of the way. The longest run she had done to that point was a 10 miler on flat ground. Did I mention that the Columbia Marathon is hilly? Julie had signed up for the half marathon but she handed her metal off to my husband and rejoined me. Without her I could not have made it.</p>

    <h2>Ironman Maryland 2016</h2>
   I was a part of Ironman Maryland in 2016. The swim was canceled and the bike was shortened to 100 miles. I finished it. I really had nothing more to prove. In the minds of the Ironman officials, you are an Ironman. No one can take it away from you. But in the minds of the participants, we felt cheated. The shortened races just leave us feeling empty. We just did more than most people think about doing yet we feel cheated. Why? None of us can answer that question. Maybe it is because in our circle of friends, we know our race will always have an asterick beside it because it was shortened. This asterick may not be visible but it is there. In our minds, in the minds of our friends that have done a 140.6 mile Ironman. That 126.2 mile Ironman race on October 5th, 2016 is just not the same. The conditions on race day were far less than ideal. The bike ride was rainy and windy.  The tide came in and flooded parts of the run so we got our swim in while traversing the knee deep water.. The first "little person" to compete in an Ironman race remarked that the water was "up to his bits." I guess he really did swim the run. But I finished that race. Why on earth did I feel cheated. Why did I feel that I needed to do it again? To this day, I can't answer that question. But I would be back....That decision was made mentally before a 24 hour period had passed</div>
<div id = "lou2017" class="divPosition"><p>The minute the registration opened for Ironman Louisville 2017, myself and some fellow masochists, Cindy, Debbie and Kelly, signed up for another year of uncertainty. And FYI, this is an expensive "hobby." The gear we buy, the traveling to the race, none of this is cheap. The new year brought a new adventure and many hours of swimming, biking and running. Truthfully, the only real reason we can come up with to continue this "hobby" is because we love the company. Good friends make suffering bearable. We endured 100+ degree heat out at Fort Gordon, our local bike-safe training ground. Out there, we are in more danger of taking ourselves out than being injured by passing motorists. I have been participating in triathlons since 2010 and to this day, I do not feel comfortable sharing the road with cars. The Savanah River is our favorite swimming hole. Well, most of us anyway. Some of us just can't seem to get past the idea that alligators really are in there.</p>
<p>Kelly, Cindy, Debbie and I trained a good bit of the summer together. The day had finally come to see if the hours had paid off. Kelly had completed a previous Ironman (Chattanooga 2015). Debbie had DNF'd a previous Ironman race so she knew what it felt like. I had finished the shortened Maryland race the previous year but still came back for more. Cindy was the only one who was truly in it for the first time. Cindy and I had gone to Louisville to preview the bike course and I thought it was easier than Fort Gordon. The weather was going to be bad. We had no idea that our record swim times were going to be our future undoing. You see, that approaching wind storm was what pushed us down the Ohio River. My swim time was 1:18 for 2.4 miles. A full 20 minutes faster than I had expected. It is going to be a good day right?</p>
<p>Oh how very wrong I was. The first miles of the bike were not terrible. When I say the first few miles, I mean the first 45 miles. Remember this is a 112 mile bike ride. Then the rain and the wind arrived to escort us on this journey. The rain is one thing but the sustained gusts of wind reached 40+ miles per hour. It took all most of us had to keep our selves upright and in one piece. But we all made it back safely. Transition is one of the most parts of any endurance race. This is where you prepare your mind and body for the next phase. The saying is that you can't win an Ironman during the swim but you can sure loose one. The same can be said for transition as well. Decisions you make there can make or break you. The decision I made in transition would change my future....</p>
<p>I had had trouble all summer with my feet blistering. Even on short runs, I put Glide on my feet to prevent. To this day I can not explain what in the heck I was thinking in Louisville. I held the Glide in my hand but put it back in my bag. WHY!!!! There is no logical reason that I can think of. I was in trouble by mile 5 of the 26.2 mile marathon.</p>
<p>Once the race begins, you are left with two choices. Keep moving forward, no matter what or stop, quit in other words. During an endurance event, you are faced with this choice many times. For myself, it is almost always during a run. I am a slightly above average swimmer, high mid-pack. From there, it is all downhill. My cycling speed is slow, my run is only slightly better than a speedy walk. But the key is to keep moving forward. Each step gets you closer to the finish line and the coveted words "You are an IRONMAN! And the medal of course. Can't leave without that. To decide to pull the plug on a year's worth of suffering is a decision we do not take lightly. So even with my blistering feet, I kept going. That was until like mile 16 or so when I began to lean forward, as in "face plant forward." I could not hold my body upright. My remaining forward motion was being created by the effort of trying to keep myself from falling. I held on till mile 20, just 6.2 miles short of the medal.  I had passed the last cut-off and could have continued if could figure out how.I briefly considered crawling the 6.2 miles but just did not think it was "doable!"</p>
<p>Ironman races have a total time limit of 17 hours. Louisville has a time-limit of 16.5 hours. Not sure why but that is the way it is. Darkness is probably the main reason. But each athlete has 16.5 hours to complete the race. Within the race, there are other cut-off times. The swim has a 2 hour and 20 minute cut-off. For the bike course, you have 8.5 hours the complete the 112 miles but you also an intermediate cut-off at mile 56 of 4.25 hours. That gives you 4.25 hours to complete the remaining 56 miles. By contract, the roads must be opened to traffic by a certain time. If a cyclist is stil on the course they hunt you down, stop you and your race is done. Debbie can tell you how that process goes. The run has several cut-offs. Cindy did not make the run cut-off at mile 13 and was pulled off the course. During the run, I told myself many, many times that I would never, EVER do this again. EVER!!! But just two days after, even before my blistered feet healed, Cindy and I decided that we would go back to Louisville.</p>
<p>Those are just some of the elements you face during this type of endurance sport. The mental aspect of it you will not realize until you are out there. The "WHY" aspect of this type of torture. WHY on earth do we volunteer for this type of crap? What do we actually get in the long run? Is there really a reward at the end? Do we really put ourselves through this just for some weird sort of personal satisfaction? The "WHYS" are far more numerous than the answers.</p>
<p class= "louTwoPrep">Que up the next semi-fails! Since we decided that we were undertrained for Louisville 2017, Cindy and decided that we would return in 2019. Our goal was to do the Augusta Half Ironman and register for Ironman Louisville 2019 as soon as it opened. The Augusta Half Ironman turned out to be another reverse "PR" for me. I have gotten slower not faster. The Augusta Half Ironman has a cut-off time of 8.5 hours. If you are over 8.5 hours, you may be allowed to complete the course but will be shown as a DNF on the Ironman site. My time for the 2018 Augusta Half Ironman...8.29.58!!! I kid you not! I was a mere 2 seconds from a DNF and had no idea. My watch said I had several minutes, not a lot of time but more than the official clock anyway. But the official clock is the only clock that matters.</p>
<p>In addition to the Augusta Half Ironman, I signed up for the Columbia marathon...again! It was just so much fun the first time right? Plus a half marathon in April and a 70.3 in May. Not a single one of these events went as planned. I sunk to the level of my training or lack of it again.I was not ready for the Columbia marathon so I switched to the half marathon and the only good thing was I only had to run Gervais Street once instead of twice! 3 hrs and 10 minutes I think anyway. The next event, the Aiken United Half marathon was flat and not the slightest bit easier. My time was even slower. 3:13 or so. Nothing was going right. Next was the Goosepond 70.3 in Scottsboro,Alabama. Did that go better? Oh heck no! The only good thing is I won my age group simply because I was the only one in it!!! And for that race, I was again only minutes from the 8.5 hour cut off. Louisville is now looming just 5 months away.</p>
<p>We kept the training up. We rode at Fort Gordon nearly every weekend. I ran every weekend. I switched to SlayRx for hydration. No way this was going to turn out bad again, right? Five months is a long time unless you have an Ironman race looming ahead. Then it is over in a flash. Cindy decided to drop out of the race because of a work situation. Nancy S., affectionatly known as "other Nancy" was going strong but when Cindy dropped out, I was left with no training partner. I had no idea how grossly inadequate by training was. Since I was not riding with anyone, I had no one to gauge my progress or lack of it with. Bad MISTAKE! With no coach and no partner, I was floundering and had no idea! I truly thought that my bike and swim were adequate. I knew all along that the run was my Achille's heel. I didn't expect much and was not going to get much. All I needed to do was get off the bike with 7 or more hours left on the clock and I would have just enough time to walk if I had to or so I believed anyway. Things were going to turn out so very different from my hopes....</p>
<p>The unseasonably warm weather caused the Ohio River to develop a bad case of green algae. At first, it looked like we may be OK but at the last minute, the Ironman officials were forced to cancel the swim. Been there, done that, right? The first-timers were throughly crushed just as I was in Maryland 3 years before. But health and safey are two factors that can't be overlooked. While disappointed, we still were going to get the pleasure of a 110 mile hilly bike ride and 26.2 mile marathon. Not many people can fathom just those two elements in a single day. But the swim cancellation was coupled with shortening the total race time. Our total race time was now 14 hours and 45 minutes instead of 16 hours and 30 minutes. It really didn't register with me that we were losing 1 hour and 45 minutes of our alloted time. This was going to be a huge factor for me in just a little while...</p>
