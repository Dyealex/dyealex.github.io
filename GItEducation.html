<p>Git is the program that we are using in class to store our work. I had never heard of it until this ordeal began. Once I have gotten use to it, it is OK. Those first few days had a huge learning curve attached to them. I was pushing my stuff to another former student. I was not saving the items correctly and there was major issues getting the stuff at home to the computer at the school. But it is finally done. And I get up this morning and github will not load!!! Goal for this project is to get the information on the page and then style it out.

<h3>Gitting use to Git</h3>

<p>Some of the git items that are crucial to your mental health are...</p>
<ul>
<li>To git your list of directories
    <ul>
<li>Type <em><span id = "boldDesign">ls</span></em> into the console. Walah!</li>
<!-- one of life's great mysteries...will work every where but here!!!! -->
<p id ="elEss">(That is l as in "el" and s)</p>
<li>Up pops a list of the directories on your computer</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<br>
<li>Say you need to be in a certain directory...
<ul>
<li>To change directories, type <em><span id = "boldDesign">cd ../</span></em> and the name of the one you want to be in.</li>
<li>That will git you where you want to be.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<br>

<br>
<section id="paragraphThree"><br>
   
    <h3>Gitting a new directory is simple...</h3>

    Now suppose the directory you want is not on the computer. Maybe you need one that is called "stuffIScrewedUp"...it is simple enough to do. All you have to do is simply type <span id= "boldDesign">mkdir</span> and the name you have chosen for your new directory and hit enter. Gitting a new place is just that simple.</section>
<br>

<!-- I do not know what this header is suppose to do -->
<!-- done to here... -->
    <!-- <header id="theHeader">Git a new directory</header> -->
    <!-- the header represents introductory content, typically a group of intro or navigation aids such as links, links to other sections, logos, search button and other stuff so this should be at the top of the page... -->
    <div id = "paragraphFour">
    <h4 id= "gitAhead">Where the heck am I?</h4>
  <p>Say your directory structure looks something like this....</p> <p>directory/subDirectory/subSubDirectory</p>      
    Your current location is the subSubDirectory. But...you want to be in your subDirectory. Once explained, this is really simple.
<!-- </article> -->



<h4 id= "gitAhead">Going back is as simple as cd ../!</h4>
<p>That command is <span id = "boldDesign">cd ../</span> and hit enter and that gits you back to the directory up from where you are. You are now in your subDirectory.</p>
<!-- <p>I have found myself here but this is not where I want to be...</p> -->
<!-- </article> -->


<!-- <article> -->
    <h4 id= "gitAhead">To step back to directory, repeat!</h4>
    <p><em><span id = "boldDesign">cd ../</span></em> will then take me back to directory. (Was that so hard?)</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraphFive">
    <h3>Gitting Tricky!</h3>
Now that whole github thing is somewhat tricky at first. I spent a lot of time getting stuff straightened out.
<br>
When you change something you need to "push" it to github. Once on github you can access it from anywhere but it you make some changes and forget to "push" Lord help you! It takes Nick a lot of time to get it back right.
<br>
Those commands go something like this....
<br>
First and foremost...make DANG sure you are in the directory you intend to go back to to look for this stuff!!!!
<br>
Next, after you are CERTAIN this is where you want to be...in your console type
<br>
<span id = "boldDesign">git add .</span> and hit enter
<br>Then you type...
<br><span id = "boldDesign">git commit -m "added text"</span> and hit enter
<br>Next, you will push your stuff by typing...
<span id = "boldDesign">git push</span> and hitting enter.</div>
<div id = "importantParagraph">
<h3 id= "pull">This is IMPORTANT!</h3>
<p>If you do work on another computer, you will need to git this off of git hub before you do ANYTHING! If you don't, well I am sure it can be fixed but it will not be easy. (Refer to the microsoft rant, insert article link here.)</p><br>
<p>To retrieve your changes from github heaven, you will need to pull your work. It is a simple as <span id = "boldDesign">git pull</span>...but again, make darn sure you are in the correct directory. Refer to the article "where the heck am I above...insert link here.</p>
</div>

    <p>Git Bash/ Git Hub and NotePad++ are all products of Microsoft...which explains why they do not work correctly! I believe even Visual Code Studio is a Microsoft product. Again explaining why the stuff does not work right. My opinion of Windows is it is a self-replicating virus that will fill up a small hard drive in a very short time.</p>
    <p>Maybe because Microsoft head quarters is in Seatle, Washington, they take the many rainy days they endure and come up with new, creative ways to make our lives interesting. I just know that every weekend since I joined GitHub, it refuses to load during the wee hours of the weekend mornings. If I could afford a Mac, I would have one. Thank you Microsoft!</p>

<div class="paragraphSix">

<p>Now how do the instructors git our homework. Well, as of yesterday afternoon, none of us knew! I can tell you what I did but do NOT know if it was correct or not. There seems to be a LOT of us stuck on that grocery store app. I have not given up but just ignoring it for now. The steps I took in hopes of getting my work to them were as follows....
<br>And I can't get to github yet so I will go by memory...HahHah!

             <tfoot> click on save changes or whatever it is. Since I can't see it, I am not sure.</tfoot>
    
        
    </table>
<p>If you follow these steps, the crap goes somewhere, I am just not sure where!!!!
</p>
<p>That is pretty much the extent of my git knowledge but I do plan to git more!</p>
