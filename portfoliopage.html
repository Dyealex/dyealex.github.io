    <p>What can I say about me? I have been with my husband 36 years. That is longer than a lot of people in this class  have been on the earth. My career as a press operator began 36 years ago on the letterpress side of printing. This style of printing gave way to the technology of offset printing and was phased out. Now it is considered a high-end style of printing. Technology has now taken over my job so I am trying to get into technology. Technology has been taking over jobs since the beginning of time so why should mine be different? There are no jobs in my field so I will soon be forced out. Frankly, I can live the rest of my life without hitting the start button on a press ever again! Presses are pure diabotical creations that will cause you to pull your hair completely out or randomly burst into tears. There is at least some logic to technology and the answers are there somewhere. You just have to find them. With printing, what works one day may never work again. It is nearly guaranteed!</p>
    <p>All our "children" have fur. 12 cats, 3 dogs and a turtle.  Anyone who knows me knows that I love turtles, snakes and reptiles in general. When I was in school, I loved Biology and wish I had been a better, more focused student. The turtle is suppose to belong to my great niece but she was scared of it when it was the size of oversized quarter and now I can barely get my hand around his fat, overfed shell. Chances are pretty good that this turtle is mine forever. He has outgrown at least four aquariums and is close to outgrowing #5! I am thinking his next "house" will be a kiddie pool outside. My other "pets" are fish. I resisted for a long time getting an aquarium because I did not want to have to clean it out. Now I can't imagine not having one in my house. I can watch the fish for hours. I waited for months to finally have my first baby guppy appear. That fist one now has 8 siblings and I have become the operator of a "guppy mill."</p>    
    <p>During the winter of 2017, I tried to enter Western Governor University. Since I had no college credits, I needed to obtain one or two before I could be admitted. I decided to get English Composition 101 out of the way first. I really enjoyed the writing the thesises for the course. One, "I am an Athlete," tells of my transition from couch potato to triathlete. Another, gave me unbelieveable insight into the opiod crisis gripping the nation. I wrote one comparing reptiles to amphibians. All of these works I am truly proud of. I loved the research and putting it all together for a finished product. The learning curve was the process of writing correctly. I have an English teacher in my circle of friends who helped me and kept me straight with the assignments. I may be able to write forever but to write correctly takes thinking. I finished the course and recieved my college credit. I will continue once fianances and time allows me to.</p>
    <p>So how did I did I go from WGU to coding? Pure, dumb luck! I contacted a friend of a friend and he told me about it. It was all new to me at the time but I looked into it and decided to give it a try. Since November or so, I have spent a great deal of time and energy on it but still feel totally lost! The hours of Udemy have paid off but not to the degree that I had hoped. I only know that I truly enjoy the challenge of all the elements. Liking what you do is half the battle. The "eureka" moments when you stare at something that will not work for hours then you finally fix it are priceless.</p>
    <p>My free time for the past 3 plus years have been occupied with training for Ironman races. The original plan was to do Ironman Maryland in 2016 and be done. But everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. I did the third and FINAL Ironman race on Oct. 13th, 2019. I finished but barely. 6 months later, I have ZERO desire to ever do this again. For the complete boring story of my Ironman quest see <a href="theironmandnc.html" target="blank">My Ironman Journey</a>...That quest for an Ironman medal changed me over the past three years. I found a determination and drive that I did not know existed before. David Goggins and his audio book "Can't Hurt Me" are what kept me going for this final Ironman. There is NOTHING you can't do if you are willing to suffer for it. His words do not simply apply to physical quests but mental ones as well. I am convinced that is it had not been for David Goggins and my good friend Debbie, there is no way I could have finished Ironman Louisville. Putting the journey into words has been theraputic for me.</p>
    <p>In my limited free time, I dabble in stained glass. After trying mosaics, it is far more forgiving and less stressfull than the glass work. Since I do so little of it and so seldom, I can't get good at the soldering. Crafters are pretty harsh critics of their own work. And if there is an imperfection in the solder, I will ruin the whole piece trying to fix it. The cutting of the glass has to pretty precise to fit properly and I can't get the hang of it and spend a lot of time recutting pieces. While I am not training for any "big" races, I am still trying to keep my fitness. This class has made it a challenge to fit it all in. The cycling and swimming have fallen way off but I still try to run on the weekends. Now that the time has changed, I may get out there in the afternoons soon.</p>
    <p>Many of our pets are not on the pet page yet but I hope to finish it soon. Some are very camera shy.<br> I am a plain, no nonsense person. This page is simple and plain because this is how I live my life. The crumbled paper is an appropriate background for a printer. The brick wall with the stained glass window appeal to my simple taste. Just keep it simple...</p>
