    <p>To decide to participate in an Ironman race takes a fair amount of determination, tenacity and guts. When I started participating in triathlons in 2010, I could not wrap my head around how you could possibly think this was &ldquo;doable&rdquo;&excl; To swim 2.4 miles, bike 112 miles and run 26.2 miles...all in the same day. The sprint distance triathlon I was preparing for seemed far-fetched and it was a mere 600yd swim, a 13 mile bike ride and 3.1 mile run. Plus to go out there with the knowledge that you are not an elite athlete; maybe not even a so-so athlete takes courage. Hitting the send button on the registration only begins the journey. The double digit runs, the 100 mile bike rides, hours in the pool. All of this to prepare for the uncertain. The uncertain is...will the race be canceled? It can and has happened. Will the race be postponed? That can and has happened. Am I ready? You will find out. What diversity will I face on raceday? These are all unknowns. The only thing for certain is you just spent a lot of money on a maybe. Maybe I will finish...this time.</p>
