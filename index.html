        <h1>What about me?</h1>
        <p>What can I say about me? I have been with my husband 36 years. That is longer than a lot of people in this class  have been on the earth. I have been a press operator for 36 years as well. Technology has now taken over my job so I am trying to get into technology. Technology has been taking over jobs since the beginning of time so why should mine be different? There are no jobs in my field so I will soon be forced out. I would have been out a few years ago if I worked for anyone but the man I work for.</p>
        <p>My husband and I have no children, only pets. 12 cats, 3 dogs and a turtle. To see all our "children" click here. That turtle is suppose to belong to my great niece but she was scared of it when it was the size of oversized quarter. I can barely get my hand around his fat, overfed shell now so chances are pretty good that she will never want this turtle back. He has outgrown four aquariums and is close to outgrowing #5!</p>
        <p>How did I decide I would like to try coding for fun? Pure, dumb luck. I contacted a friend of a friend and he told me about it. It was all new to me at the time but I looked into it and decided to give it a try. Since November or so, I have spent a great deal of time and energy on it but still feel totally lost! The hours of Udemy have paid off but not to the degree that I had hoped.</p>
        <p>My free time for the past 3 plus years have been occupied with training for Ironman races. The original plan was to do one and be done but that did not work out quite as planned. I did the third and FINAL Ironman race on Oct. 13th, 2019. I finished but barely. For the complete boring story of my Ironman quest see <a href="Ironman AAR.html" target="blank">My Ironman Journey</a>...
        </p>
        <p>In my limited free time, I dabble in stained glass. After trying mosaics, it is far more forgiving and less stressfull than the glass work. Since I do so little of it and so seldom, I can't get good at the soldering. Crafters are pretty harsh critics of their own work. And if there is an imperfection in the solder, I will ruin the whole piece trying to fix it. The cutting of the glass has to pretty precise to fit properly and I can't get the hang of it and spend a lot of time recutting piecses.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, I would like to have a nav bar at the top with tabs and but this will have to do for now. I am working on getting pictures of all the pets but weather was so bad Sunday that I did not get to it.</p>Prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds chase ball of string. You have cat to be kitten me right meow eat all the power cords. Ears back wide eyed. Pretend not to be evil floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes.

Plan your travel climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face the door is opening! how exciting oh, it's you, meh destroy the blinds yet claws in the eye of the beholder chase laser for tuxedo cats always looking dapper. Eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender bite the neighbor's bratty kid, and stare out the window, groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep as lick i the shoes. Plan steps for world domination nya nya nyan.
