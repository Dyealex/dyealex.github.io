        <p>What can I say about me? My husband and I have been married 33 years.  I began my career as a press operator around 36 years ago on the letterpress side of printing. Much of what I did was manually choosing letters by hand and inserting then into a form for printing. This form was inked up and the paper is then "pressed" onto the form. Hence the term "letterpress." Today, you will find these drawers repurposed to display small knick knacks. The "automation" for letterpress printing came along in 1886 with the invention of the linotype machine. There is a small town newspaper in Colorado that still produces its weekly paper using a linotype machine. The local shops here mothballed their linotype machines and their hand-set type back in the mid-80s. Now days it is considered a craft rather than a form of printing. Letterpress machines are used for dye-cutting, embossing, perforating and numbering so it will likely never be eliminated entirely. Because special forms and equipment are needed,  only a few local shops keep the equipment required to do it. </p> 
        <p>Letterpress printing gave way to the technology of offset printing. I was lucky enough to be cross-trained to operate the offset presses. Technology has now taken over my job again so I am trying to get into technology. Technology has been taking over jobs since the beginning of time so why should mine be different? I will soon be forced out. Frankly, I can live the rest of my life without hitting the start button on a press ever again! Presses are pure diabolical creations that will cause you to pull your hair completely out or randomly burst into tears. There is at least some logic to coding and the answers are there somewhere. You must find them. With printing, what works one day may never work again. It is nearly guaranteed! I could write a book of "Murphey's Laws" that apply to operating a printing press.<br>
             People occasionally ask me "What exactly do I do" and it is hard to explain so I created a slideshow that gives you an idea of how four color process printing works. Black, cyan(blue), magenta(red) and yellow ink combine with four individual plates to achieve a dot pattern that creates the photo. Plates are installed on the press and then they must be moved to precisely register with the next plate until they are all aligned and the dot pattern of each color is in its correct position.

        <p>All our "children" have fur. 12 cats, 3 dogs and a turtle.  Anyone who knows me knows that I love turtles, snakes, and reptiles in general. I loved Biology when I was in school and wish I had been a better, more focused student. The turtle is supposed to belong to my great niece but she was afraid of it when it was the size of oversized quarter and now I can barely get my hand around his fat, overfed shell. Chances are good the turtle is mine forever. He has outgrown at least four aquariums and is close to outgrowing #5! I am thinking his next "house" will be a kiddie pool outside. My other "pets" are fish. I resisted getting an aquarium because I did not want to have to clean it out. Now I cannot imagine not having one in my house. I can watch the fish for hours. I waited for months for my first baby guppy to appear. That fist one now has 8 siblings and I have become the operator of a "guppy mill."</p>    
        <p>During the winter of 2017, I decided that I was going to enter Western Governor University to obtain a degree in Information Technology. Since I had no college credits, I needed to obtain one or two before I could be admitted. I got English Composition 101 completed by using StraighterLine, a partner of WGU. I really enjoyed the writing the theses for the course. One, "I am an Athlete," tells of my transition from couch potato to triathlete. Another, gave me unbelieveable insight into the opioid crisis gripping the nation. I wrote one comparing reptiles to amphibians. All of these works I am truly proud of. I loved doing the research and putting it all together for a finished product. The learning curve was the process of writing correctly. I have an English teacher in my circle of friends who helped me and kept me straight with the assignments. I may be able to write forever but to write correctly takes thinking. I finished the course and recieved my college credit. I will continue once finances and time allows me to.</p>
        <p>So how did I did I go from WGU to coding? Pure, dumb luck! I contacted a friend of a friend and he told me about it. It was all new to me at the time so I investigated it and decided to give it a try. Since November or so, I have spent a great deal of time and energy on it but still feel totally lost at times! The hours of Udemy have paid off but not to the degree that I had hoped. I only know that I genuinely enjoy the challenge of all the elements. Liking what you do is half the battle. The "eureka" moments when you stare at something that will not work for hours then you finally fix it are priceless.</p>
        <p>My free time for the past 3 plus years have been occupied with training for Ironman races. When you commit to doing a full Ironman race, you commit to spending all available time on training. The original plan was to do Ironman Maryland in 2016 and be done. But everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. Bad weather on race day cancelled the swim and shortened the bike portion. Because my quest for a full Ironman race seemed incomplete, I decided to give it another try. In 2017, I focused on Ironman Louisville. The weather was awful that day as well but none the race was shortened. On this day, my body decided that 134.4 miles of the 140.6 was enough and I collapsed at mile 20 of the run. Only 6.2 miles left and I could not continue. I did the third and FINAL Ironman race on Oct. 13th, 2019.</p> <img src="bikephoto.JPG"><br><br>
        <p>Warm weather caused an over-growth of algae in the Ohio River so Ironman Louisville 2019 also had to cancel the swim. I survived two falls on the bike portion uninjured and I managed to finish the event but barely. When I say "barely" I am referring to the fact that I was the very LAST participant allowed across the finish line. There were only 20 seconds remaining. A training regimine that spanned 4 plus years came down to the very last seconds. The official race record shows me as a DNF (did not finish) but I have the medal that proves I did! <br>(I have ZERO desire to ever do this again.)</p><video id = "onTop" width="500" height="315" controls><source src = "myfinish.mp4"></src></video>
        <img id = "medal" src="medal.jpg" alt="My Medal">  
        <p class="paraEight">The quest for this Ironman medal changed me over the past three years. I found a determination and drive within me that I did not know existed. The audio version of David Goggins' book "Can't Hurt Me" are what kept me going for this final Ironman. There is NOTHING you can't do if you are willing to work for it. His message applies to both physical and mental challenges. Had I not discovered David Goggins just six weeks or so prior to race day or if my good friend Debbie had not been beside me the last 6 miles, I doubt that I could have finished Ironman Louisville. <br>I still struggle with self-doubt at times but I make myself return to the last mile of that 2019 race and realize "This is nothing compared to that!"</p>
        <p>In my limited free time, I enjoy creating stained glass and mosaic projects. The quality of a finished soldered project depends on the glass cutting and the soldering. Both require a great deal of practice and since I do so little of it and so seldom, I can't get proficient at either. Crafters are harsh critics of their own work. If there is an imperfection in the solder, I will ruin the whole piece trying to fix it. The cutting of the glass needs to be precise to fit properly. I can't get the hang of it and spend a great deal of time recutting glass. A mosaic project is far more forgiving! While I am not training for any "big" races, I am still trying to maintain some of my fitness. The cycling and swimming have fallen way off but I still try to run on the weekends.</p>
