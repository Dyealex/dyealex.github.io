    <p>To decide to participate in an Ironman race takes a fair amount of determination, tenacity and guts. When I started participating in triathlons in 2010, I could not wrap my head around how you could possibly think this was &ldquo;doable&rdquo;&excl; To swim 2.4 miles, bike 112 miles and run 26.2 miles...all in the same day. The sprint distance triathlon I was preparing for seemed far-fetched and it was a mere 600yd swim, a 13 mile bike ride and 3.1 mile run. Plus to go out there with the knowledge that you are not an elite athlete; maybe not even a so-so athlete takes courage. Hitting the send button on the registration only begins the journey. The double digit runs, the 100 mile bike rides, hours in the pool. All of this to prepare for the uncertain. The uncertain is...will the race be canceled? It can and has happened. Will the race be postponed? That can and has happened. Am I ready? You will find out. What diversity will I face on raceday? These are all unknowns. The only thing for certain is you just spent a lot of money on a maybe. Maybe I will finish...this time.<br>The journey is different for all of us. This is MY journey....</p>

           Ironman Maryland 2016</h4>
    I took part in Ironman Maryland in 2016 with Julie as my training partner. Maryland has a flat bike ride and a flat run but the could be "iffy." The previous year's race was postponed for two weeks because of a hurricane. Once again, the unknown is what you can't prepare for.</p> <br>

   <p>That 126.2 mile Ironman race on October 1st, 2016 wass just not the same.  The conditions on race day were far from ideal. The bike ride was rainy and windy. The tide came in and flooded parts of the run so we got our swim in while traversing the knee deep water.. The first "little person" to compete in an Ironman race remarked that the water was "up to his bits." I guess he really did swim the run. But I finished that race.  on earth did I feel cheated. Why did I feel that I needed to do it again? To this day, I can't answer that question. But I would be back....That decision was made mentally before a 24 hour period had passed.</p>

The swim was canceled and the bike was shortened to 100 miles. I finished it. I really had nothing more to prove. In the minds of the Ironman officials, you are an Ironman. No one can take it away from you. But in the minds of the participants, we felt cheated. Julie had done an Ironman race already so she was not concerned or bothered by the shortened race. The shortened races just leave us feeling empty. We just did more than most people think about doing yet we feel cheated. Why? None of us can answer that question. Maybe it is because in our circle of friends, we know our race will always have an asterick beside it because it was shortened. This asterick may not be visible but it is there. In our minds, in the minds of our friends that have done a 140.6 mile Ironman, there will always be that asterick beside our race.</p>
